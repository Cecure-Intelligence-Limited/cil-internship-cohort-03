A database is where data is stored
A database is either a relational database or non-relational database

A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of 
rows and columns found in most traditional database systems. 

A relational database is a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them. These items are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows. Tables are used to hold information about the objects to be
 represented in the database.

## Differences between a relational database and a non-relational database include:

 Relational database:
 * SQL is a relational database management system(RDBMS)
 * Databases are vertical scaled, they have a fixed schema and are used for complex queries
 * SQL is a table-based database
 * SQL has a predefined schema
 * If your organization needs to store structured data, 
 an SQL database may be the best option
 * Examples include: MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite and others

Non-Relational databases:
* NoSQL is a non-relational or distributed database management system
* Databases are horizontally scaled, they have a dynamic schema and are not good 
for complex queries because they are not as powerful as SQL
* Database has a dynamic schema
* NoSQL is used when the organization works with a huge amount of data, the data is not strongly related,  
the data is not structured and the database needs to consistently scale
* Examples include: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, CouchDB and others

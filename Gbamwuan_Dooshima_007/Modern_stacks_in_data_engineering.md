Modern Stacks in Data Engineering include:

* Data infrastructure as a service: Moving of infrastructures thereby requiring specializations where services Snowflake, BigQuery and Firebolt offer as pay-as-you-go service which out performs any data infrastructure both in terms of stability and cost effectiveness

* Data integration services: A data integration service is programming that can connect to a source system, extract data, transform it and incorporate it in a target system along with data from other source systems. 

* Mountains of Templated SQL and YAML: 


* ELT > ETL: While an ELT based transformation approach is not new (personally I’ve been doing mostly ELT over ETL for the past 2 decades), this approach is increasingly settling as the common approach. I


 Reverse ETL is a more recent addition tackling integrating from data warehouses and into operational systems (read SaaS services here) seems like a modern new way of tackling a subset of what traditionally we might have called Master Data Management (MDM) 

* The rise of the analytics engineer: It’s been amazing to see analysts perfect their SQL and learn tools like git and jinja, for the data engineer, this means, It’s clear that managing mountains of templated SQL has been in-scope for data engineers since the early days

* Data literacy and specialization on the rise: An increase of data skills

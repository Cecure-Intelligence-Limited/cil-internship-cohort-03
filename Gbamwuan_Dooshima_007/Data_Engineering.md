Question: Explain the steps in data engineering

Attempt:
First what is data engineering?
Data engineering is a set of operations aimed at creating interfaces and mechanisms for the flow and access of information. Data engineers ensure that data is available for data scientist and analyst through the creation of automated pipelines

Steps involved in data engineering include:
a. Extract: This retriving of incoming data. Raw data is dealt with the beginning of the pipeline from numeroud sources, so what this step entails is to write lines of codes that run on a schedule extracting all the data gathered during a certain period
b. Transform: Upon extraction of data, it is not always in a useable format, so the data engineer again goes to work to render it in the correct format. The essence of which can not be overemphasized as it improves data discoverability and usability
c. Load:The transformed data is now loaded (saved) in a destination usually a relational database management system (RDBMS), a data warehouse or hadoop. Each storage option has it own use and reliability

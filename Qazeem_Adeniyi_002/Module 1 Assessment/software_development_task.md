# SCRUM
Scrum is a software product development strategy that organizes software developers as a team to reach a common goal creating a ready-for-market product. Scrum is a lightweight agile process tool. 
A product owner makes a prioritized wish list known as a product backlog. The scrum team takes one small piece of the top of the wish list called sprint and plans to implement it. The team completes their spring backlog task in a sprint (2-4 weeks period). They assess progress in a meeting called daily scrum where they address the roadblocks.

## Benefits of Scrum In Software Development
- Developers who want freedom to make decisions thrive I scrum teams. Teamsâ€™ morale tends to be high.                                                                   - High quality low risk product is developed because the highest priority requirements are addressed first
- Incremental process shortens to the time to market by almost 30-40%.
- It gives room for flexibility because project focus and goals can change with evolving business goals.
- Reviewing each sprint before moving to the next sprint speeds testing throughout development.

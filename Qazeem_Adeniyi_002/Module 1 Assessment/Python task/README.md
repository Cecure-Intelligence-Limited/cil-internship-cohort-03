# Creating a User Defined Python Function

#### This function was created to help copy and resize jpeg images. 

#### Most times, when we copy files, we copy to another folder or location on our computers. Because of this, I wrote a function that can copy files from a path to another different path on the system. 

#### All you have to do insert your different location paths of the image as arguments when calling the function. Then you input your height and width measurement of the image.

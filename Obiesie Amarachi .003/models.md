SERVICE MODELS
There are three major type of service models available on the cloud although there are others like Identity as a service and Network as a Service. Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service. Software as a Service is just software that you don't have to install on your machine, and you don't have to manually update.  PaaS takes advantage of all the virtualized resources from Iaas and then just abstracts them away, so the user doesn't have to worry about managing any of those virtualized resources. 
1.  INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE (Iaas): is a form of cloud computing that delivers fundamental compute, network, and storage resources to consumers on-demand, over the internet, on a pay-as-you-go basis. The cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer. It also provides access to fundamental resources such as physical machines, virtual machines, virtual storage, etc. Apart from these resources, the IaaS also offers:
•   Virtual machine disk storage
•   Virtual local area network (VLANs)
•   Load balancers
•   IP addresses
•   Software bundles

    USE CASES
Test and Development: Organizations today are using cloud infrastructure services to enable their teams to set up test and development environments faster, helping create new applications more quickly. Also helping developers focus more on business logic than infrastructure management.
Business continuity and disaster recovery:  IaaS is helping organizations reduce this cost and make applications and data accessible as usual during a disaster or outage.
High-performance computing: to solve complex problems involving millions of variables and calculations such as climate and weather predictions and financial modeling.
EXAMPLES 
•   Microsoft Azure: it is a cloud platform that makes it possible for customers to manage, create and test application.
•   Digital Ocean:  offers cloud hosting services to businesses looking to scale their data in the clouds
•   Amazon Web services (AWS): is an Amazon cloud computing service that offers a variety of products that propel data management strategies. 
•   Google Cloud Infrastructure: It is an innovative company, and its cloud infrastructure business is built in the same mould. 
•   IBM cloud: This allows their IaaS users to get unprecedented access to the hardware that lies beneath their Cloud service
2.  PLATFORM AS A SERVICE (Paas): is a cloud computing model that provides customers a complete platform to develop, deploy manage, and run applications created by them or acquired from a third-party. The PaaS provider hosts everything—servers, networks, storage, operating system, application runtimes, APIs, middleware, databases, and other tools at their data center. The provider also takes responsibility for the installation, configuration, and operation of the application infrastructure, leaving the user responsible for only the application code and its maintenance. Customers pay for this service on a usage basis and purchase resources on-demand. With IaaS, the cloud provider offers access to ‘raw’ computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking, while the user is responsible for the platform and application software. With PaaS, the cloud service provider delivers and manages the entire platform infrastructure, abstracting users from the lower-level details of the environment. Developer may log on to these websites and use the built-in API to create web-based applications. But the disadvantage of using PaaS is that the developer locks-in with a particular vendor.
The following diagram shows how PaaS offers an API and development tools to the developers and how it helps the end user to access business applications.
 
ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PaaS
•   High level of abstraction they provide to the users, eliminating the complexity of deploying applications, configuring infrastructure, and provisioning and configuring supporting technologies like load balancers and databases.
•   PaaS clouds provide services and APIs that help simplify the job of developers in delivering elastically scalable and highly available cloud applications; services that includes a variety of capabilities such as APIs for distributed caching, queuing, and messaging, file and data storage, workload management, user identity, and analytics, thus eliminating the need to integrate disparate components
•   PaaS provides built-in security, scalability, and web service interfaces.

USE CASES
•    API development and management: Organizations are using PaaS to develop, run, manage, and secure APIs and microservices, which are loosely coupled, independently deployable components and services. 
•   Internet of Things, or IoT: PaaS clouds support a broad range of application environments, programming languages, and tools used for IoT deployments. 
•   Business analytics/intelligence: PaaS tools allow organizations to analyze their data to find business insights that enable more informed business decisions and predictions. 

EXAMPLES
•   App Engine of Google 
•    Force.com 
•   Salesforce: a San Francisco based cloud provider whose services extend to PaaS. 
•   SAP Cloud
•   AWS Lambda 

3.  SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE (SaaS):  model allows to provide software application as a service to the end users. It refers to a software that is deployed on a host service and is accessible via Internet. SaaS providers maintain the servers, databases, and code that constitute an application. They also manage access to the application, including security, availability, and performance. Applications reside on a remote cloud network, and users use these applications without having to maintain and update the infrastructure.

CHARACTERISTICS
•   SaaS clouds have a multitenant architecture
•    SaaS makes it easy for users to manage privileges, monitor data use, and ensure everyone sees the same information at the same time. 
•   Users can customize the UI to work with their branding guidelines; they can modify data fields and enable or disable features within the business process.
•   They are available on demand.
•   They can be scaled up or down on demand.

USE CASE
•   Transitioning from Exchange to Cloud-Based Corporate Email and Calendaring: Software as a service (SaaS) is essentially an ‘on-demand software’ or in other words ‘applications-as-a-service’ because it refers to a software application that is carried to the end client as a service over the Internet.
EXAMPLES
•   Email and collaboration via offerings such as Microsoft's Office 365 and Google's Gmail.
•   Customer Relationship Management via services such as NetSuite CRM and Salesforce.
•   Human Resource Management via services from Workday and SAP SuccessFactors.
•   Lumen 5: is a leading video creator SaaS app that lets businesses create amazing videos with its drag-and-drop interface.
•   Buffer:  It is a simple yet effective tool that helps social media management and scheduling easier for businesses of all sizes.
4.  IDENTITY AS A SERVICE: Identity refers to set of attributes associated with something to make it recognizable. All objects may have same attributes, but their identities cannot be the same. A unique identity is assigned through unique identification attribute. refers to a wide variety of cloud-hosted services for identity and access.

USE CASE
•   Identity and access management (IAM) solutions store information about parties (e.g., administrators, business units, end-users) and resources (e.g., files, shares, network devices, products, agreements), along with the rules governing access to those resources. IAM solutions apply these rules to determine who can access or manipulate a resource.
•   Create and issue a Credential

EXAMPLES
•   Telenor Norway
•   VMware workspace
•   Okta Identity Management
•   OneLogin
•   Auto0

NETWORK AS A SERVICE: allows us to access to network infrastructure directly and securely. NaaS makes it possible to deploy custom routing protocols. In this, the third party provides the network infrastructure. NaaS consists of services such a wide area networking connectivity, data center connectivity, and bandwidth on demand.
 
USE CASE
•   Tier1 APAC Operator Leverages Amdocs’ NaaS Solution: Before embarking on the path to NaaS, the operator’s services were designed with physical network functions plugged into rigid physical networks, which were siloed from the operational support systems (OSS) and business support systems (BSS). Provisioning a new service was largely manual and required the operator to send technicians into the field to install and configure the equipment. It resulted to: Long timelines to provision services and correct problems, Higher operational costs than necessary, Slower innovation and Limited agility.

EXAMPLES
•   SD-WAN, security, and unified communication as a service, as well as cloud computing, data centers, infrastructure.
•   virtual network functions.
•   Virtual Private Network (VPN)
•   Cloudflare Magic WAN
•

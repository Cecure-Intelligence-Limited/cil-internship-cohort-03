# SERVERLESS COMPUTING

Serverless or serverless computing is a cloud-based execution model in which cloud service providers provision on-demand machine resources and manage the servers by themselves instead of customers or developers. 
The popularity of hiring vendors for handling application backend has spiked tremendously over the last 5 years. On the one hand, startup owners go serverless to save infrastructure costs and pay for resources as they go. As the company scales, relying on third-party vendors allows getting access to backend resources as quickly as possible.
Although implementing cloud-based infrastructures is mainly popular among startup owners, large-scale companies use distributed architectures as well. Amazon Polly, for one, fully relies on AWS for project support.

BENEFITS OF SERVERLESS FOR STARTUPS
•	SIMPLE DEPLOYMENT AND CONTINUOUS DELIVERY: Unlike a server-based architecture, the backend for distributed systems is easier to set up and deploy. Connecting the source code to whichever serverless security for startup vendor platform you chose (AWS, Google, Azure, etc.) is all it takes to deploy the project. Continuous delivery is another benefit of joining serverless and startups. Every change to the code is deployed automatically after testing. The entire process is automated.

•	COST-EFFICIENT: Serverless can offer more cost-efficiency than buying or renting servers where you pay for resources even if you don’t use them. Serverless employs a pay-as-you-go model where you will pay only for the resources you consume.  The serverless provider will charge you only for the memory allocated and time to run the code without incurring costs for idle time.
As a result, you will save on operating costs for tasks such as installation, licenses, maintenance, patching, support, etc.

•	SCALABILITY: On-server apps have scalability limitations. Serverless systems offer a high level of scalability as you can scale up or down whenever you want based on the demands. They are also called “elastic” for this reason. The cloud provider you chose is responsible for managing all that. In addition, developers from small teams can also run their code by themselves without requiring support engineers or infrastructure. The increasing number of users means the need to rebuild and renovate the tech backbone of the app. That’s why companies that prioritize traffic or user acquisition prefer serverless startups development for its next-to-infinite scaling power.

•	REDUCED LATENCY: As apps are not hosted over a single origin server, you can run the code from anywhere. If the cloud provider you have chosen supports it, you can run app functions on a server close to end-users. Hence, it incurs less latency due to reduced distance between the user requests and server.

•	PRODUCTIVITY: The serverless model helps improve your developers’ productivity as they don’t have to handle server management. Also, they don’t have to think about managing HTTP requests or multithreading in their code directly.
As a result, it simplifies backend development, all thanks to FaaS, where exposed code are event-driven functions. All of these save the time that they can dedicate to improving the code and application.

•	FASTER APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT: With serverless, developers don’t perform backend configuration or upload code to the server to deploy an app version. They can also quickly upload the code in bits to release new products. Continuous delivery is another benefit of joining serverless and startups. Every change to the code is deployed automatically after testing. The entire process is automated — there’s no need for your team to watch over every update. They also have the flexibility to deploy code at once or function one after the other as it’s not a monolithic architecture.

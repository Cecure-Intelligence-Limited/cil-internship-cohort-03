# 1. Explain the difference between cloud data engineering and Data engineering. Also, list out the technologies used in these two cases

**Cloud data engineering** is also known as a cloud engineering or cloud development, is the process that involves the management of corporate apps and data in the cloud and all the technical tasks involved in planning, architecting, migrating, monitoring, and managing a company’s cloud systems.<br>
**Data engineering** focuses on applying engineering applications to collect data trends to analyze and develop algorithms from different data sets to increase business insights. This can be an onpremises activities.<br><br>
The crucial task of **a cloud engineer** also involves working and collaborating with other professionals and technical teams to identify and implement **cloud solutions** while the **Data engineer** has the task that deals with managing, organizing, developing, constructing, testing, and maintaining **data architectures**. Finding hidden data patterns in large data sets to research industry and business requirements is also an important task for data engineer.<br><br>

## Technologies used in Cloud data engineering:

- Cloud Services and provides: AWS, Microsoft azure.
- IDE for Coding: Vscode, Python, Netbean to program in python, C++, Java etc.
- Operating System: Windows, Linux, open-source operating system.
- Distributed Data Storage Systems: AWS S3 or MongoDB and so on.
- Distributed Data Processing Systems: Apache Spark, Map Reduce.
- Cloud Computing Platforms: Services from AWS, GCP, and other cloud providers
- Database: SQL, Hadoop, and MySQL.

## Technologies used in data engineering:
- Databases: SQL, NoSQL, MySQ
- Programming Languages: Python, Scala, Java, etc.
- Data warehouse
- Data modeling
- ETL (extract, transform, load)
- Big data analytics
- Software development

## 3. Explain some software engineering practices for Data Engineers
- Clarity in code: One of the most important aspects of code quality is clarity. Clear and readable code is crucial for collaboration and maintainability.

- Code Modularity:When building something that can be reused in the same or other projects, then there is need to organize the code into logical functions and modules. This helps for better organization and maintainability.

- Make your code efficient: Writing efficient code that executes fast and consumes less memory and storage is another important software engineering practice for data engineers.

- Use GIT or any other version control system: using GIT + Github helps to improve coding skills and better organize the projects. Since version control is used while collaborating with friends and/or colleagues, it makes one stick to standards.

- Code Testing: When building a data pipeline that executes a series of operations, one way to make sure it performs according to what it’s designed to do, is to write tests that check an expected behavior.

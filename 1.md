Describe a layered processes similar to OSI model
A similar process similar to the OSI model is the TCP/IP five-layer network model. TCP/IP means Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and makes it possible for devices connected to the internet to communicate with one another across networks.
1.	The physical layer deals with the hardware devices on the network and represents the physical devices that interconnect computers. It transmits moving bits across the wires and modulation (line coding) also. This layer specifies characteristics for trusted pair cabling, duplexing and network ports.

2.	The data link layer is responsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals so network devices can communicate. Deals with the ethernet and Media Access Control (MAC) addresses to transmit data. It provides error control and framing through a technique called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with collision detection (CSMA/CD). Cyclical redundancy check (CRC) is performed here to ensure that all data arrived intact.


3.	The Network or internet layer allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers. This layer accepts and delivers packets for the network. This layer includes the Internet protocol (IP) which is responsible for IP addressing (IPv4 & IPv6) and host to host communications. Other protocols here are the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)

4.	The transport layer sorts which client and server programs are supposed to get that data. The protocols at this level are the transmission control protocol (TCP) and user datagram protocol (UDP). The TCP handles reliable delivery of information from one network to another and the IP is responsible for delivering packets to the right computer.


5.	The application layer has application-specific protocols. Protocols that allow to browse the web or send receive email. This layer is closest to the end-user and allow users to interact directly with software applications.

Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of it's benefits in software development.

Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. It is a subset of agile software development and a product development strategy that makes developers carry out tasks to achieve their common goal. Some features of scrum are product backlog, sprints and daily meetings.

Benefits of Scrum

•	Better product quality
•	Faster Return on Investment (ROI)
•	More Control
•	Reduced risk
•	Improved customer satisfaction


From the Agile Manifesto, complete the following:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

# DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLOUD DATA ENGINEERING AND DATA ENGINEERING
Data engineering is the practice designing and building systems for collecting, storing and analyzing data at scale. It is a broad field with applications in just about every industry. organisations have the ability to collect massive amounts of data, and they need the right people and technology to ensure that the data is in a highly usable state by the time it reaches the data scientists and analysts.

Data engineering process involves using different data storage and manipulation tools together to build and maintain data pipelines while you integrate the operation of big data. So a data engineer should have a deep understanding of many data technologies to be able to choose the right ones for a certain job
  
  
 ## The major difference between a Cloud Data Engineer and a Data Engineer is that the tools used to build and maintain data pipelines are situated in the cloud for a cloud data engineer  while that of the Data Engineer is on premise i.e the Cloud Data Engineer tools are cloud based while Data Engineer tools are premise based. This statement means that they both perform data engineering process but they use different tools and technologies to achieve their goals. 



A Cloud Data Engineer focuses on managing different cloud services to provide an integrated package to customers according to their requirements. A Cloud Data Engineer analyzes the customerâ€™s needs, the amount and type of data they have, and the result of their operations. They also decide the best tools and services so that customers can use them to have optimal performance. A cloud data engineer is expected to be well versed on the best practices for deploying and managing cloud systems and applications on the cloud and needs to implement and ensure adherence to these best practices across the corporation. 

Data Engineer is a technical person who is responsible for architecting, building, testing, and maintaining the data system. They are responsible to find recent trends in datasets and create efficient algorithms to make data more useful. They need required skills like programming, mathematics, and computer science, experience, and also soft skills to communicate the trends of data which help the business growth.

# Service Models, their use cases and 5 samples for each of the models

## Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): 
For IaaS, you manage the server which can be physical or virtual, and the operating system (Microsoft Windows or Linux). IaaS provides end-users with cloud-based alternatives to on-premise, physical infrastructure. **Examples:** AWS EC2, Google compute Engine (GCE), Digital Ocean, Rackspace, and Microsoft Azure.

## Platform as a service (PaaS): 
In PaaS, someone else manages the underlying hardware and operating systems. In this way, you can run and deploy applications without managing underlying infrastructure (for example, patching, updates, maintenance, hardware, and operating systems). **Examples:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, OpenShift, Google App Engine, and Apache Stratos.

## Software as a service (SaaS): 
In SaaS, you manage your files while the service provider manages all data centers, servers, networks, storage, maintenance, and patching. You handle only the software and how you want to use it. You are provided with a complete product that the service provider runs and manages. **Examples:** Facebook, Slack, Email, Amazon Workspace, and Dropbox are examples of SaaS.

# Comparison of the different use cases for different kinds of databases. 

## SQL: 
Stands for Structured Query Language. It's used for relational databases. A SQL database is a collection of tables that stores a specific set of structured data. Examples: RDS, MariaDB, Oracle, PostgreSQL.
* Execute queries against a database
* Retrieve data from a database
* Insert records into a database
* Update records in a database
* Delete records from a database
* Create new databases, or new tables in a database
* Create stored procedures & views in a database
* Set permissions on tables, procedures, and views

## NoSQL: 
NoSQL databases store data in key-value rather than relational tables. Examples: Memcached, Cassandra, Neo4J.DynamoBD, 
* Support large numbers of concurrent users (tens of thousands, perhaps millions).
* Deliver highly responsive experiences to a globally distributed base of users
* Be always available â€“ no downtime
* Handle semi- and unstructured data (flexile schema)
* Rapidly adapt to changing requirements with frequent updates and new features

## GraphQL: 
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a server-side runtime for executing those queries. It allows you to fetch only the data that your app is requesting from the server and nothing more.
* Reducing app bandwidth usage
* Complex and composite systems
* Microservice based architectures
* Rapid prototyping

# OSI MODEL

The OSI model has 7 layers which are listed below:
- Application layer
- Presentation layer
- Session layer
- Transport layer
- Network layer
- Data-link layer
- Physical layer
	
A similar layered process is the TCP/IP model which is describes hierarchy of how devices intercommunicate with each other on the internet
The layers of the TCP/IP model are listed below:
- Application layer
- Transport layer
- Internet layer	
- Network access layer
	
The TCP/IP model is similar to the OSI model as they are both logical models that define the communication process between devices in layers.
Also they both describe, logically how data packets are moved from node to node. Lastly they both can be used as logical guide in troubleshooting process.

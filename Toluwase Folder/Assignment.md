ASSIGNMENT 1 (LAYERED PROCESS SIMILAR TO OSI MODEL)
Layered Structure of Operating System
A layered structure of an Operating system is a type of system structure in which the different services of the operating system are split into various layers, where each layer has a specific, well-defined task to perform. These layers are as follow
1)	Layer 1 (Hardware)
2)	Layer 2 (CPU scheduling)
3)	Layer 3 (Memory management)
4)	Layer 4 (Process management)
5)	Layer 5 (I/O Buffer)
6)	Layer 6 (User programs).
Hardware: This layer interacts with the system hardware and coordinates with all the peripheral devices used, such as a printer, mouse, keyboard, scanner, etc. These types of hardware devices are managed in the hardware layer.
The hardware layer is the lowest and most authoritative layer in the layered operating system architecture. It is attached directly to the core of the system.
CPU Scheduling: This layer deals with scheduling the processes for the CPU. Many scheduling queues are used to handle processes. When the processes enter the system, they are put into the job queue. The processes that are ready to execute in the main memory are kept in the ready queue. This layer is responsible for managing how many processes will be allocated to the CPU and how many will stay out of the CPU.
Memory management: Memory management deals with memory and moving processes from disk to primary memory for execution and back again. This is handled by the third layer of the operating system. All memory management is associated with this layer. There are various types of memories in the computer like RAM, ROM. If you consider RAM, then it is concerned with swapping in and swapping out of memory. When our computer runs, some processes move to the main memory (RAM) for execution, and when programs, such as calculator, exit, it is removed from the main memory.
Process management: This layer is responsible for managing the processes, i.e., assigning the processor to a process and deciding how many processes will stay in the waiting schedule. The priority of the processes is also managed in this layer. The different algorithms used for process scheduling are FCFS (first come, first served), SJF (shortest job first), priority scheduling, round-robin scheduling, etc.
I/O Buffer: I/O devices provide users with the means of interacting with the system. This layer handles the buffers for the I/O devices and makes sure that they work correctly. Suppose you are typing from the keyboard. There is a keyboard buffer attached with the keyboard, which stores data for a temporary time. Similarly, all input/output devices have some buffer attached to them. This is because the input/output devices have slow processing or storing speed. The computer uses buffers to maintain the good timing speed of the processor and input/output devices.
User Programs: This is the highest layer in the layered operating system. This layer deals with the many user programs and applications that run in an operating system, such as word processors, games, browsers, etc. You can also call this an application layer because it is concerned with application programs.
ASSIGNMENT 2 (Basic Networking/ IP addressing)
1)	The NS IP address for Google is 216.58.223.196
•	The NS IP address for Facebook is 102.132.101.35
•	Nslookup tesla.com brought many ip addresses which includes 104.86.104.55, 104.89.119.127, 184.50.204.169, 184.30.18.203, 2.20.92.122 and 23.201.26.71.
2)	The Ip address 10.10.10.0 can be broken down to the following subnets
•	10.10.8.0
•	10.10.9.0
•	10.10.10.0
•	10.10.11.0
The IP address 192.168.0.0 can be broken down to the following subnets
•	192.168.0.0
•	192.168.1.0
•	192.168.2.0
•	192.168.3.0
     The IP address 172.168.1.0 can be broken down to the following subnets
•	172.168.0.0
•	172.168.1.0
•	172.168.2.0
•	172.168.3.0
NOTE: a total of 1016 hosts can be generated from the subnets 
ASSIGNMENT 3 (SCRUM)
1)	Scrum  is one of Agile methodologies design as a Project management framework that helps organizations in project management, product management, software development. Etc. Unlike the waterfall approach where the steps involve in project managements are Requirements, Design, Development, Testing and Maintenance. Scrum looks at splitting software development process into small concrete deliveries in order of priorities. Instead of taking longer time to deliver a product/project, it takes short time. The scrum team are headed by a scrum master who coordinates and make sure the team follows the plan. There is a daily scrum meeting to access what has been accomplished so far, what will be done differently and what challenges were faced during the previous day.
Benefits in Software Development.
1)	Higher productivity: Team collaboration and engagements enables/foster high productivity. I.e. successful delivery of each backlog gives the team a sense of achievement and productiveness instead of working on a single project/product for a long period of time.
2)	Lower Cost: working on a project/product for a whole year or two years costs a lot of money and for example if after the whole development the product/project failed during the testing phase then all the money spent so far is wasted. But splitting these tasks into small deliverables and making sure each backlog works will save time and cost.
3)	Better Employee Morale: scrum improves employee morale.
4)	Greater ability to incorporate changes as they occur.
5)	Enable Better engagement with the customer and also improves customer satisfaction.
6)	Foster Faster Return on investment
7)	Quality: Quality. Maintaining quality is a key principle of development with Scrum
8)	Reduced Risk. Etc.
2)	From Agile manifesto
•	Individual and interaction over Processes and tools
•	Working software over Comprehensive Documentation
•	Customer collaboration over Contract Negotiation
•	Responding to change over Following a plan.
